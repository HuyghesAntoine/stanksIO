## Description 

This is the final project of our last year in Bachelor Degree in ULCO Calais.
This is a browser game, with mobile controler. 

## How to play 

Launch [this link(empty)]() to access the home page of the game.
Click on [the play button(empty)]() to access the game page, and click on [the controler(empty)]() to access the control page.
You have to use the control page on your mobile phone.
Use the joysticks to move and shoot towards a specific direction.
**Your main objectif: kill the other tanks.**

## functionalitys

* Each player **control** a tank.
* Chose a class and a name.
* Each tank can **move** and **aim** with the two joysticks.
* **Left** joystick to move.
* **Right** joystick to aim.
* Collect **green dots** to gain experience and score points.
* Collect **red hearth** to regain life point. 
* Upgrade your tank with your levels. They are different according to the class.
* Multiple tank evolutions.

## Development team  

* **Skibinski Pierre** :Project manager and in charge of the game engine.
* **Pecqueux Th√©o** :  In charge of the game controls.
* **Villette Vincent** : In charge of the networking process.
* **Huyghes Antoine** : Git master and in charge of the graphic part of the game.

## Development   

Each developer has a branch with their name. They can add their own modifications to this branch. When a developer want to put his code on the master branch and give it to everyone, he just have to create a **merge request** on the git respository. The git master just have to take a look on this request and validate it, or not.
We can help each others if someone is stuck on a problem for to long.

## Conclusion 

* Self-critism : 
    * Not enough organisation at the begining of the project.
    * Everyone was working on the same things. 
    * But at the end of the first / second day, everyone was focus on his own objectives for the project. 
    * Maybe we should have spend more time on the *project management*.
    * But our branch organisation was perfect for us. 
    * That's new to us to create something from A to Z and it's a good source of experience for the futur.

* If we had to redo it : 
    * Keep the same developer team, we had good communications and it was fun to do. 
    * Chose another game to make. The snake was our second choice to be honest.
